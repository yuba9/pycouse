Uri's comments:
==============

* Very good! This code works.
* I recommend styling your code according to PEP-8. You can also use PyCharm's
  Code -> Reformat Code feature. For example, spaces around "*", spaces after comma etc.
  This is relevant to all your exercises.
* Here is how your code looks reformatted:

n = int(input("Please Enter your age (in years): "))
y = n * 12
print("your age (in months) is:", y)

* It's better to end a Python file with a line break.
  If you use PyCharm's Code -> Reformat Code feature, it will be done automatically.
  This is relevant to all your exercises.
* It's better to create a folder for each exercise and put the files in it.
* It's better not to use special characters such as "#" in file names.
